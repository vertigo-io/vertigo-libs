/**
 * Inter-components events manager.
 * Publisher / Subscriber on event type for communication between components.
 * Listeners are configured to listen on the same JVM.
 *
 * The process is synchronous.
 * the suscribers execute their methods on the same thread.
 * The errors are not caught.
 * If one of the suscriber throws an error, this error is thrown on the post().
 *
 * The purpose of this pattern is to decouple the managers.
 * Managers that post don't need to know which components are listening.
 *
 * Example :
 *  - flushes local cache when an object is updated, deleted, inserted in the store
 *
 * WARNING :
 *  By default, EventBus is not distributed.
 *  A cache component should listen : a modification in one node should flush cache all over the system : it's cache component responsibility to do this
 *  An audit component should listen to do the audit log
