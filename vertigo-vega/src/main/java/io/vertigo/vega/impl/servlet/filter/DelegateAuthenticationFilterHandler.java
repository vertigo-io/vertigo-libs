 * The Vertigo Security Filter {@link io.vertigo.vega.impl.servlet.filter.SecurityFilter} can delegate the authentication workflow to a custom compoment.

 * This delegate has the hability to execute function before/after the filter chain and has a callback for a finally block.
 * It is executed after the creation of the UserSession (in Vertigo's terms) so you're in the right place to populate the fined grained security context for the connected user.
